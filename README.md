# WPFConverterLibrary

Library of Value Converters for WPF

There are a number of fairly common converters used across a wide range of WPF apps. This library is intended to catalog some of these,
and can serve as templates to copy from or use as inspiration in your own projects.

Some of these converters were adapted from other open source projects.  References to those are found in the individual converter files
to give credit where credit is due!
